# Collab-Repo
---

Everyone has been added as a collaborator to this repository, meaning you can all contribute files.

Click on the Code icon, SSH, and copy the address for the remote repository. **Create a local repository**
on your computer and link the two.

Once linked, make sure you **pull** all the files from main.

**Create a new branch**, including the last 4 digits of your student number at the end of the branch name.

Your task is to create a new file, where the file name follows the format below:
`A_B_C.txt`
Where 
-A is your favourite colour
-B is your favourite animal
-C is a random number from 10 to 99

**Example:**
`Silver_Goldfish_22.txt`

**Save, add, commit, and push** the files to your branch.

Finally, create a **pull request** for your branch. Assign me (Johnathan-Spinelli) as a reviewer for your pull request.

Once everyone has completed this task, we will have a giant repository full of files through this collaborative exercise.
